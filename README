Changes from V2.2.Jared:
- sources is now an array of structures
   - astrophysics_initialize.m updated
   - optics_propagate.m updated

- Created orbit class
   - added orbit.m to define the class
   - this class contains the orbital elements
   - methods to caculate period and x/y/r, etc.
   - star_initialize and planet_initialize now take an object of type orbit as an argument  

- Added 2nd star
   - star_initialize now projects an orbit for the star (handling a=0 for the main star)
   - planet_initialize now projects planet position relative to star position (x(t), y(t))
   - astrophysics_initialize now accepts arrays of structures for both stars and planets
   - main.m now adds alpha Cen B with the elements of Pourbaix 2002
   - result is 3 sources: 2 stars and 1 planet orbiting star 1.
   
   
Changes in V2.3.Jared (photons):
- Now initialize star with either star name ('acenA' or 'acenB') or a spectral type ('G2') and distance.
- Blackbody used to determine photons/m^2/micron/sec at central wavelength
- Multiplied by filter width
- New files:
   astrophysics/photometry/blackbody_phot.m
   astrophysics/sptype_numeric.m
   astrophysics/sptype_params.m
- Changed files:
   main.m
   star_initialize.m
   astrophysics_initialize.m
